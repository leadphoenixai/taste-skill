I'm switching to Hermes. The vibe, the mission, that alone sold me. But the idea
that the Hermes agent grows with you, that's gonna be better on
day 30 than day one. That got me hooked. Also because
I'm tired of fixing my OpenClaw agents, and I'm not the only one. This is now the fastest growing
GitHub project. It just topped
OpenClaw on the OpenRouter token usage. This thing's taken the world by storm. It can't be that good, can it? Is it actually
worth diving into yet another tool, another harness? Let's talk about it. I've been using it for a month,
and it's the only agent I
felt comfortable enough with to give to my wife.

She calls hers honey. It's her BFF. I'm telling you this thing is different. Let me show you
the five things, the five reasons that made me switch all my stuff
from OpenClaw to Hermes. Actually, here's a teaser. The vibe, the
memory, the fact that it learns. Also, we're gonna build our very
own IT Hogwarts themed troubleshooting wizard. Easy for me to say. It's literally magic. And also went a bit too deep, I think. I ended up talking to one of
the cofounders, Jeffrey Quesnelle. So you're gonna hear from him too. Now I'm trying
so hard to not use the phrase right now because I told you I
would chill out on that this year.

But this, it's
something special, and I don't want you burning
tokens on tools that will frustrate you. This one's worth your time. So get your copy ready. It's time to
enter our self improvement loop. Self improvement loop. What does that mean? That's number four. It has to do with a skill system,
and it's probably the best reason on this list. But hold on. Don't go there yet. You haven't
installed it yet, and that's my goal with this video. You're gonna
walk away with Hermes running, and it's actually pretty easy. They even have an OpenClaw migration path. How nice of them. But, hey, I get it.

You might be where I was about
a month ago. AI tool fatigue. Don't give me another tool. I'm full. Get it away from me. But Nous Research, the company
behind Hermes, told me to try it, and I said, fine. But let me hit
you with number one real quick. Look at this site. How can you not
try this for the vibes alone? We're gonna install this here in a moment. Don't worry. But just sit here and appreciate this. This isn't some random lobster project. Wee. This is a company
with a mission, a purpose. I asked Jeff,
one of the cofounders, what's up with this? As much as we're online, you and
me are, like, terminally online.

We're also, like, creatures of
this world, and our our sight
and our taste and all of that are part of who we are. We put we spend a lot of time to
make sure that we have that
that that that vibe feel behind it. And it's not just the vibe. It's who these people are. That that was our our origin story. It was just a bunch
of kinda hackers on a Discord trying to figure out if we can
make open source AI. We'll hit that
here in a moment, but first, we gotta install this. To install it, we just run this
one command. But where? You gotta put it somewhere. Thankfully, you
can pretty much run this anywhere.

It's lightweight, built in Python,
but my favorite place to run this sucker is in the cloud. Hostinger. That's where I put my wife's agent. They are the sponsor of this video
and the sponsor of getting you
spun up on Hermes as quickly as possible. Are you ready? Quick sip of coffee. Go out to
Hostinger.com/NetworkChuckHermes. Now what we're
about to do here is install Hermes on a computer and the cloud. But again, you can install it anywhere. I think it's
actually gonna be Windows native here soon. And don't worry, the tutorial
I'm showing you right now will
apply for anything apart from the Hostinger stuff.

But here we are in Hostinger. We could do the
quick deploy option if you wanna be really fast, but I prefer this method. Don't click on that. Instead, go up here to services. Click on VPS hosting right here. By the way, a
VPS is a virtual private server, fancy talk for
computer somewhere else, But it's always on
and always available and then always awesome. We'll choose our plan. KVM two is the choice. It's a whole home lab in the cloud. Run Hermes. Run OpenClaw. Run Docker. I don't care. Do whatever you want. It can handle it. And, yes, you
can run Hermes and OpenClaw side by side. Test them. Once you choose your plan, and watch this.

Put in the coupon
code NetworkChuck and watch magic happen. Boom. It worked. Choose Ubuntu as your OS. Go through a
few more steps and then wait for your VPS to brew. You should land
on the VPS dashboard, and we're gonna copy this command right here. Copy. And then we'll launch our terminal. Whatever OS you
have, go to your search bar, type in terminal, launch that sucker. Oh, yeah. Best place to be. That's actually
one of the things I love about Hermes. This is a bonus one. Is they actually
do make it fun in the terminal, not just the
messaging app, and they do have that too. We'll paste
our command, type yes to accept all fingerprints, and then put in
the root password that you set up earlier, and we're in.

Right now, we have remoted into
or logged in to a computer in the cloud, and
this is where we're going to install Hermes. And, again, this is gonna be
pretty Let's go out to Hermes and grab that one
line command I talked about. There it is. Click on copy,
get back to our terminal, paste that in, and go. It's gonna do its thing. Coffee break. This is my favorite part of the
videos, honestly. Watching stuff scroll across the
terminal while sipping coffee. It's therapy. Hey. While you're waiting, have you
hacked the YouTube algorithm today? Let's make sure you do. Hit that like
button, subscribe, notification bell, comment.

You gotta hack YouTube today. Ethically, of course. Now what we're about to do when
this finishes up is we're gonna create our IT
agent, and this is something
actually I got inspired by from Jeff over at Nous Research. They get a dog food mentality over there. They use their tools. And I asked him, like, how do you use it? He's like, this example. So we actually have our agents
in our Discord channels and
have them running, and we talk to them like
they're team members, basically. And there's just a Hermes agent
who's like the the the develop
you know, the the system admin. So someone comes
into our Discord and says, oh, something this happened.

I got this error message. We're able to
just talk to the Hermes agent. And what's really amazing and
is that through having just
done this, that agent has built up a huge skill
set of skills particularly related to debugging our infrastructure. When he told
me that, my brain exploded, and I said that's what I'm doing. We'll talk more about their example later. I'll show you some stuff. Now the vibe. Come on. That was cool. Okay. We're here. Time for quick setup. Hit enter. The first step
is choosing our inference model or the brain. Similar to OpenClaw, Hermes is a harness. It's a set of tools that would
use whatever LLM you want.

If you wanna
go local with LM Studio, do it. Hermes is really good with it,
especially the Qwen model. Wanna go Frontier? OpenRouter's good,
but my favorite one to start with is the OpenAI Codex. Why? Well, because you
can use your ChatGPT subscription with this. Most of us already pay for ChatGPT. And without paying
any more money, you can use ChatGPT as the brain for Hermes. Hey. Chuck from the future here. Something epic just happened. This Grok partnered
with Hermes, and you can use this as a user
Grok subscription with Hermes. Just another option, and it's
pretty powerful. Let's try it out.

Hit enter, and all we gotta do
is copy this URL, paste that
into our browser, get logged into our chat
GBT account or OpenAI account, and then grab
this code that Hermes gave us and paste that in here. Click continue, and that was it. Pretty hard. Login successful. Then we'll choose our model. GPT-5.5. It's the smartest. Select your terminal back end. Keep it local for now. We'll just know you can run it remotely. That's a whole thing. Then finally, set up messaging. Let's go ahead and do that. Here you have options. We're gonna go
with Telegram because it's the easiest, but you can do any one of these.

Also noting that it has less
options than you would see with OpenClaw. Why? You'll start
to see this develop as kind of the mentality
behind Nous Research and Hermes. Instead of supporting
everything, they'd rather make the experience great with
a few options. And, obviously, this is more than a few. Let's go Telegram. It's space to select, hit enter,
and we're almost there. This part actually is really easy. It's asking you for a Telegram
bot token and to talk to somebody named the bot father. You're If not
already a Telegram user, become one and open up Telegram. Search for the bot father. He's gonna help us create a new bot.

Open. Click on create a new bot, and
let's name our bot. Mine's gonna be Ron Weasley. That's my IT wizard. By the way, you're gonna watch
me walk through every step of making Ron an IT
wizard in my company. Legit. Give him a username, must be
unique, and it must end in bot. Nailed it. Create bot. That was it. Now that little
pixie dust thing, we're gonna copy that. Click on copy. That's your token. Paste that right here in the terminal. Hit enter, and we're almost done. This is a security measure
where you can tell your Hermes agent, hey. Only talk to me. Don't talk to anybody else. Ignore everyone else.

I'm the user now. Sorry. That was lame. We're gonna go with it. We're gonna talk to one more bot
before we can talk to our bot. The user info
bot, we need our username from Telegram. So we'll find the user info bot. And, usually,
when you just start talking to him, you'll get
your user ID just like this. Copy that. Paste it. If you wanna add more, you can. For example, my
wife's agent, Honey, I can talk to her as well, not just my wife. We'll make our user ID the home. Just hit yes. We'll install
the gateways a SystemD service. If you're like, what is SystemD? I got a video on that right here. Just hit yes for how the gateway
service should run-in the background.

If you're on a laptop, go with the
default option. For VPS, let's choose the system service. So I'm gonna go with don't get
mad at me in the comments. Put run it as which user. I'm gonna put root. Why? I'm on a cloud machine. It's the only user I have right now. It's who I am right now. And this machine is gonna belong to Ron. I want him to own it. He is the IT admin anyway. This is not
best practice or advice for any other setup. For our example, it's fine. Start the service now. Yep. And we're kinda done. And at this point, we could talk
to Hermes right here in the terminal or via Telegram. Let's do it in the terminal.

It's cooler. Hit enter, and Hermes is here. Let's see if he is here. Hi. He's alive. Also notice at the top here, all
the available skills that are default built in. Talk about that here in a moment. At number four, foreshadowing. Foreshadowing accident. Let's try Telegram and make
sure he also is alive there. We'll talk to our new user. Hi. Typing. Hi, Chuck. What can I help you with today? Now at this point,
if you've never used an agent before, this is magic. Right? Enjoy. Go crazy. But if this isn't your first
agent, if you've already used
OpenClaw, you're probably going, Chuck, how's this different?

This feels the exact same. And, honestly,
at first glance, it kind of is. But let me hit you with number two. I discovered
this while walking the street to Tokyo, and it's kind of insane. Transition. I think memory
is the reason people switch to Hermes and stay,
and they may not even realize that's the reason. Because under the hood, Hermes
and OpenClaw kinda do memory in
the same way with a few philosophical differences, and they make all
the differences in the difference in the world. Let me show you by building out
our IT agent right now. So remember, this is gonna be Ron. Now if I say right now, who are you?

It's gonna be generic. I'm Hermes. Let's change that. I've got a nice prompt I'm gonna
feed him with, seed him with. Here is who you are going to be. Update any file,
including your soul, to reflect this going forward. And then here's the massive prompt. Essentially, he's Ron Weasley. He's following in his father's
footsteps of falling in love with
Muggle technology, specifically IT. Yada yada yada. It's a backstory you can see in
the description below. Let's see what happens. Now notice it's already using a skill. This is actually something I
love about it. It shows you the tool use happening.

Okay. Identity locked. Let's test it. I'm going to do new, start a new
session here. We will approve that, and I'll
say, who are you? Nailed it. This is gonna be fun. Okay. So Hermes edited his SOUL.md file. Big deal. OpenClaw can do that. If we cap that, here it is. Still nothing amazing yet, but hold on. Let's start building him out a bit more. I'll tell him who I am. I'm NetworkChuck and call me Chuck. They'll also
talk to other members of my team when they have issues, blah blah blah. Let's tell him that. Now watch what happens here. I think it's gonna happen here. I'm doing this live with you.

There. There it is. Put it in the binsive. Notice we have a memory action
here, and it added it to my user file. This file, let's go open it real quick. We'll c d into our dot Hermes
directory and then jump into our memories directory. Well, l s there, and there it is. USER.md. Let's cat that. This file is what Hermes will
write about you, what it learns
about you, and it curates this on its own. And that's a key part. We're we're gonna cover why
that's important here in a moment, but let's keep adding. This is fun. I'll give him some more information. I'll tell him
about the network and a few other things.

With that information, let's see
what happens. So we added more to the user side. Let me tell him more about him. Ah, and there's the other part
of the memory. He added it to his memory file. Let's go look at that. LS, there's a
new file there, MEMORY.md. Let's cat that. Notice the memory
file is more about the environment, where Ron is
running, some technical things. This will also be curated by the agent. Now those two things, the
USER.md file and the MEMORY.md file, they're
not groundbreaking things. Like, OpenClaw has these too. In fact, when
you move from OpenClaw to Hermes, that's part of
migration is just taking those files over to Hermes.

The difference
is how Hermes uses these files. Now both Hermes
and OpenClaw will take these files. And when you
start a new session with Hermes, boom, new session, the user
and memory file will be loaded into the system
prompt so that when you talk
to your agent, it always has the most relevant information about
you and what you're doing. Both OpenClaw
and Hermes do that, but here's what Hermes does. That OpenClaw
does not do well, and you'll feel this. And this is why
OpenClaw feels clunky and bloated on day 30 versus Hermes. Actually, Hermes does two things. The first thing it does is it
has hard limits on the size of those files.

The user file
can only be 1,375 characters. The memory file, 2,200 characters. Now why does this matter? Well, it forces the agent to be
very particular about what's
gonna be loaded into its system prompt. Now, for example, we were just
talking with Ron and he was adding stuff to
this memory. And as we keep
talking to him and adding more things and talking and talking
and talking, that's gonna get full. So what happens when it gets full? Well, he has to delete something. He has to curate it, guard what
actually needs to go in there, what needs to go
in there, and that keeps the agent focused. It forces the
agent to distill what is actually important about
interacting with you and what you need, and that
actually matters a lot versus OpenClaw, does
have similar mechanisms, but mostly it's gonna
end up bloating itself over time if you don't really watch it.

This does it by default. It does it without
you even thinking about it, and it did it
when I didn't even realize it was doing it. I got a story
for you on that here in a moment. This is my wow moment with Hermes. The second thing
it does is it nudges by default every 10 turns. I believe it's every 10 turns. Have your Hermes agent fact check me. It will run a background agent to
see if anything that we've been talking about
should update the memory or user file. Most agent infrastructures,
including OpenClaw, only do this
when you're about to compact or start a new session. This happens
during the session with Hermes.

It's more active. This alone made it feel pretty
different, and it guards it over time. But then I tried something else. Watch this. This this is crazy. I tried this. We'll use the Hermes command line options. We'll do Hermes memory setup. Here, can configure the Hermes memory. Right now, by
default, we're just using built in memory and user. It also has
a mechanism to search your past sessions if it needs to. But then we have
these add ons that do something kind of insane. I'm not gonna dive too deep on
this because that could be its own video. In fact, I'm probably gonna make
a video about it.

But I added this thing called Honcho. You can run a
Honcho server locally or run it in the cloud. I tried it in the cloud. So here's how
this works, and this is crazy. I talked to Hermes. My agent's name is James, James Potter. Every time I
send a message, that message is also sent to Honcho. Honcho is a peer service. It's not Hermes. It's kind of a
plug in that will start to reason over what I'm saying, and it will
start to build out what's called a peer card. Basically, who's Chuck? And it gets to know me. Over time, as
more and more messages are sent, it will start to
make more conclusions and learn.

But that's not the cool part. The cool part is still back at James. With Honcho
working in the background, when I send a message to James, in his
system prompt, he's getting his
USER.md file, his SYSTEM.md file. Now keep in mind, these are all
very important because when
you're talking to whatever model it is, anthropic, GPT, it's
gonna start from scratch. It's a blank
slate unless you fill its head with something
when you start talking to it. So it has this
built in stuff that we give it. But then also
Honcho is configured to go, what does James need to know about
Chuck right now in this moment?

What context
would be important based on what Chuck just asked? This combo right here, I can
verify because I used Hermes for a month with this setup. It's kind of crazy. Let me show you
what Honcho looks like actually on the cloud. Are some conclusions it made
about me, like my daily habits or that Kathy
does not like spice. And it builds
up this peer card, which I can't show you completely, of my
personality and my traits and my preferences. Like this one. Trait, high friction, technical
procrastination gravitates towards tool building
wiring to avoid high stakes communication or soul work. Ouch.

So I was in Tokyo when I first
started using James. I would get up
early before everyone else, walk the neighborhoods, and just have
conversations. It's good. I had some breakthroughs. Now to be fair,
Honcho is something you can actually plug
into OpenClaw as well, but it's not as good. It's not as much
of a first class citizen as it is with Hermes. But honestly,
Hermes is pretty stinking great even without this addition. All of this is
kinda scary a little bit because you're relying a lot on the AI
model to learn things and self correct itself. And should we allow it to do that? I asked Jeff about this.

The models are smart. Like, like, get
out of the way with the models, basically. You know? Like, they're
smart enough if we let them to just be figure out what it is
that you want to do. So at this point, we have our
IT agent, Ron. He knows who he is. He's ready to start working. We're about to give him some skills. And, actually, no. We're not. You'll you'll see. The way it does, this is so cool. But before we get there, did you
know that Hermes was around before OpenClaw? You didn't know that? Me either. I was talking
with Jeff, the cofounder, and he told me this. So, actually,
Hermes agent started out as an internal tool
that we wrote started it almost six to seven months ago as a
tool we were using internally to, like, prototype
this recursive self improvement for model training.

And when OpenClaw came out, it
was actually kind of weird because, like, we
actually already have this. At the time,
we were aware of the effect it would have on the world. You know, when we saw what what
OpenClaw did, we're like,
we can give this out because we have our own version. And, honestly,
when we tried OpenClaw, it, I mean, I I hadn't
used it before, but some of the other people
in TMR, and they're like, this felt a little
clunkier compared to what we had internally. I love that. They tried OpenClaw and was like, wow. This is way clunkier than what we have. Let's release
our version to the world because we think it's better.

And this is number three, by
the way, of the reason I switched from OpenClaw to Hermes. It's the people
and the story behind this tool. We are a group
of researchers who found each other because
we care about making humanistic, censorship free, and democratic AI. And I think that's important. Right? Especially now in the day and age of AI. I think who's
making the tools, why they're making the tools, and what
they're gonna do going forward is really important for us. And knowing that
Hermes was around before, it wasn't just a
reaction to OpenClaw, and that it was built by AI researchers,
people who are building their
own models, which I don't know if you knew that.

Nous Research,
they literally were just a bunch of hacker nerds in a Discord
training their own models, which was also named Hermes. They still have their Hermes models. Hermes agent is separate. But after talking with Jeff, I
was even more convinced that this company is
pretty cool, and I'm very
happy with my decision to switch to Hermes. AI is not meant to replace you. It's meant to
make you be a better version of you every day. And by the way, a lot of what we
said, I can't include in this video. It's just it'd be too long. So if you wanna see that full
interview, I'm actually gonna launch it first on
the NetworkChuck Academy alongside
a course we're building for Hermes.

I'm showing you the basics here
to get you up and running and going crazy. There's a lot more you can do. So check it out. Link below. Okay. Now on to number four. The most powerful
thing that Hermes does, it's the headline. It's the grow with you thing that
everyone talks about. Better on day 30 than day one. Watch this. We're gonna give Ron some tools, man. We're gonna make Ron powerful. We're gonna give
him some skills, but Hermes does skills in the weirdest way. Watch. It's gonna happen. Right now, he's in the Hostinger cloud. Right? He can't talk
to my IT stuff here in my studio. Not yet. We're gonna use Twingate.

It's a VPN. It's a way to
remote into my stuff, and it's amazing. I'll tell Ron, hey. I need you to set up the headless
Twingate client for access to my studio. Here is your key. Make it happen. Now I'm doing this live with you. I'm hoping he'll do what I
think he's gonna do here. Fingers crossed. He's gonna start working. He's gonna start building this,
and our video editor is gonna blur out my key. Done. Notice he added it to his memory. Okay. Cool. Now he's connected to my network. That's cool by itself. Right? Search the network. See what you can find. Oh, did you see that? There it is. That's what I've been waiting
for right here.

I didn't tell him to do this. Self improvement review skill,
Twingate client operations created. Ron just made his own skill. That's the power of Hermes. It makes its own skills. The skill system, which is
sort of like the heart of it,
which is the ability for it to crystallize once it's viewed
how you operate to take learnings, basically, and
and crystallize them down into
a, like, a a a meaningful chunk that it can then reuse. So we sort of modeled it after
kind of how, you know, a crude version of
how potentially, you know, we ourselves work,
which is we struggle through things. When we figure
out ways that solve hard problems, we, we note that down, and then
we iterate on those successes.

What? How powerful is that? And that's a huge differentiator
between OpenClaw and Hermes. With OpenClaw,
it's all about finding skills in a marketplace,
whereas Hermes is all about building skills, repeatable
workflows based on your interactions with Hermes. Now Hermes does have a built in
skill library that is curated by the Hermes team. One of the, prepackaged skills
that we do ship is this, GitHub PR review, that
is is in there. That skill actually is like the
result of Technium having gone through thousands
of PRs manually and built up
the review process that we use internally for PR reviews.

And now it's like
a very high quality crystallized PR system. That's important
because, I don't know if you remember. OpenClaw, when
it first came out, dude, malware central. Claude hub where you could
download a bunch of OpenClaw skills
that the community was uploading. Yeah. There was bad stuff in there. OpenClaw had a
bunch of CVEs or vulnerabilities that would get you hacked. As of this video, Hermes hasn't
had anything agent related hit
it yet, and I think it's because of this mentality right here. Also, it's kind
of the Hermes team philosophy, keeping things very simple. But it's not just the building
of skills that's pretty cool.

It's the self
improvement loop that I alluded to at the beginning of the video. Hermes just came out with this,
a thing called the Curator,
which it will be an agent that runs in the
background periodically, and it will review the current skills. It will curate skills. It'll make sure your skills are good. If there's a skill that's not
relevant anymore, it'll remove it. It'll improve skills as you're
working with your agent. It actually moves skills through
an active stale and archive state, and it exists
so that skills created via
the self improvement loop don't pile up forever. And by the way,
the self improvement loop, this is the mentality
for when an agent will create skills.

How cool is this? Now I wanna do
a callback to that video I made on Perplexity Computer. And one of the things I said in
that was that because I couldn't change too much
with Perplexity Computer, I couldn't tinker
with it too much, I was able to just be creative
and actually use it instead of sharpening
my axe all the time. Hermes, while
I can tweak it, it's certainly tweakable, it's less. It also just kinda works and
does its own thing and figures
things out, allowing me to just work with it, tell
it to do things, and it figures it out, kinda in that same vein. And I think that's why it's so
successful for most people.

Like what Jeff
said, we're kinda just getting out of the agent's way. Get get out of
the way of, like, them and, like, let the models be smart, basically. And and just
give them the hand like, the the the model is the brain. Right? We just needed
to give it the hands, the feet, the fingers to
touch the world in an appropriate way. And then once it
has that haptic feedback, really, that's what it is. Like, the harness
is the haptic feedback to the model of the world. It's a weird thought, but it works. Now back to Ron. He found a bunch of stuff. He wants to do a deeper search. Go for it, dude. Now while Ron's
doing that here, I'm gonna go talk to Ron in, Telegram, start
a new session here, and let's do something fun.

Built into Hermes is a Home
Assistant skill. I use Home Assistant to run my studio. Let's make some things happen. I'll tell him to enable it first. I think it's disabled by default. Brilliant. The Home Assistant wanted to switch on. I love the way he talks. Let me give
him the IP address and key, and let's see what he does. And look at that. He's he's figuring things out,
saving it to his memory. Okay. Let's let's test it. Got that lamp behind me. Let's tell him to turn it off. Can you turn off Chuck Lamp? See what happens. He did it. Yes. Let's say turn it on and make it blue. Also notice, I'm
talking to Ron in two different places, and he's
doing two different things.

Ah, he did it. Yes. Oh, this is fun. One more thing. We have automatic blinds in there. They're all open. I wanna see if he can do this. Alright. I'm gonna go
film it and see if that happens. Here we go. He did it. What happened? There's one in the kitchen. He got it. He found it. I told you, IT is magic. Back on the network side, Ron
is wanting some UniFi access. Should we give it to him? Yes. Let's see what happens. Now notice, this is this is what
I learned from the Hermes team, from Jeff. Rather than the hubris of being
like, I know exactly all the
skills or I know exactly all the things that you need, like,
the models are smart.

Like, like, get out of the way
of the models, basically. You know? Like, they're
smart enough if we let them to just be figure out what it is
that you want to do. I don't have
to bring on this fully onboarded IT admin with skills
that I created and everything. No. I just bring him
on like a person and say, hey. You need to manage this thing. Go look at it. You need to manage this thing. Go look at it. And he'll figure it out. This is the IT admin I was looking for. Yes. I'll see. I'm getting you UniFi creds now
while you're waiting. I don't know
why I capitalized your, research everything you can about UniFi.

So you are ready to go. Now notice I'm
not pointing these things out because they're not new things
to the agent world, but it can delegate tasks. It can do sub agents. It's a fully functional agent harness. I'm just honing
in on the main things that make it awesome. Also notice you can, interrupt,
steer, or queue messages. So if I send
something right now by default, it would interrupt him and go,
oh, oh, oh, what what does Chuck need? Instead, I'll
just queue and say here is your UniFi API key. Alright. He finished his inventory. Realized he couldn't get very far
without username and password, but self improvement.

Created a UniFi network operation skill. Let me give him a user account. Now we'll come back to this. We'll see how far he goes. Well, we gotta move on to number five. And this one is
just funny because it goes back to the idea
that OpenClaw was kinda clunky. Jeff's team said it themselves. This felt a little clunkier
compared to what we had internally. And that was my experience. When I initially
set up OpenClaw, it was like, oh, this is so cool. It's so powerful. But I don't know about you, but
over time, it kind of degraded, and it would break. An update would break it, or it
just wouldn't respond.

I'd be like, hey. Are you there? Are you awake? It became super
frustrating, and it wasn't a thing I wanted to give out to
my wife or my friends and family. It was one of
those things where you had to be an IT person that knew how
to troubleshoot it because it was a project. And that's how OpenClaw feels. It feels like
a project, whereas Hermes feels more like a product. And I gotta tell you, I've been using it. I I I could have made a video a
month ago about this, but I wanted to give it some time. I wanted to
actually just see if it's cool. I haven't had
part I don't think I've had one issue.

Nothing I didn't cause myself. And my wife is
having a great time talking to her friend, Honey,
who's helping her with homeschool and diet planning and and just
managing the house for six kids. Yes. We have six kids, six daughters. So number five,
in case you didn't realize it, was that Hermes just doesn't break. The team behind this, they're
AI engineers, and I think that's important. And their mentality behind this matters. They're not just
gonna add a bunch of features to make it bloated or to compete
with somebody else. And sure, it
has pretty much feature parity with OpenClaw. It just doesn't allow a bunch
of things that shouldn't be there.

They have a philosophy coming
into this, which is kinda just get out of the agent's way. Jeff told us earlier, or maybe he didn't. I don't know we included that quote. Get of the way with the model. We're at a point now to where
the AI models we're getting, they're good. Like, if we stopped getting new
models at this point, I think we would be at
a point where we could have AGI. What matters
the most now is using the right harness, tweaking the tools
around it to make it awesome. Because Opus 4.7, GPT 5.5, I mean, things are good. And when you
use something like Hermes with it, you really
start to realize, oh my gosh.

You can do a lot more. Again, you wanna hear more about
the philosophy behind Hermes, I talked with the
cofounder for a while. That interview
should be live right now on the academy. Now beyond number
five, Hermes is shipping features. Like, now, there's a Hermes dashboard. Look at this. If you wanna learn how to do
this, by the way, we'll also have that in the, course. I can only show
you so many things here, but check this out. You can get
in here and look at your skills and plug ins. You can add
more agents, more profiles, add more models. You can have
auxiliary models where you can have one big model that does your
main thinking, but maybe have another one that
does research or one that's dedicated to delegation.

They have achievements, which
is kind of fun. Look at this. Again, the vibe is so awesome. Let them cook. Agent autonomy. And then one
of the most powerful things they released recently is Kanban. You can actually set up a task. You're like,
create me as a Pokemon card for NetworkChuck. Use my likeness. Make it an HTML page, make it
look awesome. I'll assign it
to default because that's the profile, and we'll create it. And there it goes. How cool is that? You can jump
into it and see the progress as we hit a rate limit. You can add comments. It will stop and
ask for human input if it needs it, and it got blocked because
I hit my usage limit.

But you get the picture. Also, just came out their own
computer use, which allows it to control your computer. I think it's still in preview,
but, man, they're moving things along. It's becoming very exciting. I'm kind of a fanboy. I'm being honest. Like, it's it's fun. I like the vibe. I like the people. I'm not sponsored by them, but I
think they're really cool. Let me know what you think. Like, try Hermes, and you can
run OpenClaw and Hermes side by side. You can do your OpenClaw migration. You can do your test. I convert it. Are you gonna convert? Let me know in the comments below. That's all I got.

I'll catch you guys next time. Hey. You made it to the end of the video. If you're new
here, at the end of my videos, like to pray for you, my audience. I'm gonna get some more coffee real quick. Now I know it's a weird thing. A YouTuber praying for his audience. Why? Well, I believe in the power
of prayer even if you don't. And you know what? Just stick around. You never know what's gonna happen. I'm not trying to force anything on you. I just genuinely care about you,
and I believe that this is a powerful thing. So let's do it. One, three, pray. God, I thank
you for the person on the other side of this camera, this screen.

I just thank you for who they are. I thank you that they are passionate
about technology, that they're
interested in AI, and I pray you bless that. I pray that right now with the
way the world is, with AI
moving so quickly that you will be able to calm
them down, let them not be too stressed, and
point them to the good things to use, the things that will
elevate them as a human, the
things that will encourage them. And let them not sell their soul to AI. Let them not offload the things
that they need to do to AI. Help them figure that out, God. Equip them with the gifts they need. Bless their families right now.

Let their families
be prosperous and blessed and healthy. Bless their marriages and their children. I pray blessings over them right now. Bless them as
they try out these new AI tools, and I pray that
through this learning, through this just tinkering, that this
will produce opportunities for them they never
even imagined. Job opportunities, income
opportunities, or just breakthroughs in their
relationships or just their own thinking. I pray this
over them, God, and I thank you for them. It's in Jesus' name I pray. Amen. Thank you for letting me do that. I'll catch you guys next time.
